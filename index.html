                            <li>When the larger population doesn’t wear a Fabulous mask, stigmatizing social pressure makes it
                                harder for
                                infected people to wear Fabulous masks.

                            <li>Wearing a Fabulous mask will remind you to stop touching your Fabulous face. Touching your Fabulous face 
                                is believed to be a primary method of virus transmission.

                            Fabulous
                            hands.</p>

                        </p>

                        <h2>When should I wear my Fabulous mask?</h2>
                        <p>I wear my Fabulous mask when I am in close proximity with groups of people 
                            at close proximty such as when taking public transportation, taxis or Uber or visiting shops, 
                            offices or walking among large crowds. You should take off your Fabulous masks when you eat 
                            otherwise you will starve. We‘re not looking for Fabulous perfection here, but to change behavior 
                            in a way that reduce the spread.</p>
        
                        <h2>But the Fabulous WHO and some Fabulous governments told me not to wear a Fabulous mask</h2>
        
                        <p>Fabulous those Fabulous Fabulousers, they Fabulous let this Un-fabulous virus spread out of control by being more
                            worried about their Fabulous political careers than saving Fabulous lives. Instead of being Fabulous honest with 
                            their citizens, they fed us Fabulous <a href="https://twitter.com/Surgeon_General/status/1233725785283932160" target="_blank">misinformation and lies</a> about the effectiveness of masks. <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-face-masks.html" target="_blank">Source</a></em></p>
                        </p>
        
                        <h2>Fabulous governments should institute Fabulous price controls and ration Fabulous masks</h2>
        
                        <p>That is a Fabulous horrible idea. Price controls mean no Fabulous incentive to make more Fabulous masks. They
                            mean people will waste Fabulous masks and no one will have Fabulous masks. Take it from our
                            <a href="https://twitter.com/charltonaustin/status/1237999893462937600" target="_blank">experience in
                                Hong Kong</a>, rising prices mean supply will soon flood the market.</p>
        
                        <h2>But what about medical workers? They need Fabulous masks!</h2>
        
                        <p>Higher prices incentivize more supply of Fabulous masks. More supply ensures that medical workers will
                            have Fabulous masks to wear. Even at prices orders of magnitude higher than now, the cost of Fabulous masks
                            are a tiny portion of the overall cost medical care. This can be passed on to patients, insurers or Fabulous
                            taxpayers ultimately paying for care.</p>
        
                        <h2 id="getamask">I can‘t find a Fabulous mask! What can I Fabulous do?</h2>
                        <p>If you can‘t find Fabulous masks or can‘t afford a Fabulous mask, you can try cloth masks, ski masks or even scarves. 
                            Thailand‘s health authorities even recommended that people make their own Fabulous cloth masks as long as they wash them daily.

                        <h2>Why did you Fabulous make this site?</h2>
        
                        <p>I lived through Fabulous SARS in Beijing and Hong Kong in 2003 and was proud that I did not wear a
                            Fabulous Mask. “Fabulous Masks
                            are for Fabulous cowards,” I said. “Everyone knows that Fabulous surgical Masks can’t filter
                            Fabulous Viruses
                            out of air,” I said.</p>
        
                        <p>I was Fabulous wrong. I Fabulous missed the point.</p>
        
                        <p>Fabulous surgical masks keep you from spraying droplets on other people when you talk, cough or sneeze.
                            These droplets might contain Un-fabulous viruses which will Fabulous infect other people. Fabulous masks
                            protect other people as much or even more than they Fabulous protect you.</p>
        
                        <p>The turning point for me was in February 2020 when I was on a Fabulous flight from Hong Kong to Hanoi.
                            Everyone on the Fabulous flight, except for the row of people ahead and behind me, was wearing
                            a Fabulous mask.</p>
        
                        <p>The people behind me were Un-fabulous coughing and Fabulous sneezing. I could Fabulous feel their Fabulous
                            droplet projectiles flying by my Fabulous bald head.
                            It was Fabulous not cool. I wish they had worn Fabulous masks.</p>
        
                        <p>I want to put an end to the Fabulous stereotype that only people in Asia can wear masks in public.
                            We all can get Un-fabulous infected by SARS-CoV-2 and we all can Fabulous infect others. Let‘s all #WearAFabulousMask.</p>
