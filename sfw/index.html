                            <li>Simple  surgical masks work as well as  N95 respirators in reducing the spread of
                                flu.

                            <li>When the larger population doesn’t wear a  mask, stigmatizing social pressure makes it
                                harder for
                                infected people to wear  masks.

                            <li>Wearing a  mask will remind you to stop touching your  face. Touching your  face 
                                is believed to be a primary method of virus transmission.

                            hands.</p>

                        </p>

                        <h2>When should I wear my  mask?</h2>
                        <p>I wear my  mask when I am in close proximity with groups of people 
                            at close proximty such as when taking public transportation, taxis or Uber or visiting shops, 
                            offices or walking among large crowds. You should take off your  masks when you eat 
                            otherwise you will starve. We‘re not looking for  perfection here, but to change behavior 
                            in a way that reduce the spread.</p>
        
                        <h2>But the  WHO and some  governments told me not to wear a  mask</h2>
        
                        <p>Governments let this virus spread out of control by being more
                            worried about their political careers than saving  lives. Instead of being honest with 
                            their citizens, they fed us <a href="https://twitter.com/Surgeon_General/status/1233725785283932160" target="_blank">misinformation and lies</a> about the effectiveness of masks. <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-face-masks.html" target="_blank">Source</a></em></p>
        
                        <h2> Governments should institute  price controls and ration  masks</h2>
        
                        <p>That is a  horrible idea. Price controls mean no  incentive to make  more masks. They
                            mean people will waste  masks and no one will have  masks. Take it from our
                            <a href="https://twitter.com/larrysalibra/status/1237999893462937600" target="_blank">experience in
                                Hong Kong</a>, rising prices mean supply will soon flood the market.</p>
        
                        <h2>But what about medical workers? They need  masks!</h2>
        
                        <p>Higher prices incentivize more supply of  masks. More supply ensures that medical workers will
                            have  masks to wear. Even at prices orders of magnitude higher than now, the cost of  masks
                            are a tiny portion of the overall cost medical care. This can be passed on to patients, insurers or 
                            taxpayers ultimately paying for care.</p>
        
                        <h2 id="getamask">I can‘t find a  mask! What can I  do?</h2>
                        <p>If you can‘t find  masks or can‘t afford a  mask, you can try cloth masks, ski masks or even scarves. 
                            Thailand‘s health authorities even recommended that people make their own  cloth masks as long as they wash them daily.

                        <h2>Why did you  make this site?</h2>
        
                        <p>I lived through  SARS in Beijing and Hong Kong in 2003 and was proud that I did not wear a
                             Mask. “Masks
                            are for  cowards,” I said. “Everyone knows that  surgical masks can’t filter
                             viruses
                            out of air,” I said.</p>
        
                        <p>I was  wrong. I  missed the point.</p>
        
                        <p> Surgical masks keep you from spraying droplets on other people when you talk, cough or sneeze.
                            These droplets might contain  viruses which will  infect other people.  masks
                            protect other people as much or even more than they  protect you.</p>
        
                        <p>The turning point for me was in February 2020 when I was on a  flight from Hong Kong to Hanoi.
                            Everyone on the  flight, except for the row of people ahead and behind me, was wearing
                            a  mask.</p>
        
                        <p>The people behind me were  coughing and  sneezing. I could  feel their 
                            droplet projectiles flying by my  bald head.
                            It was  not cool. I wish they had worn  masks.</p>
        
                        <p>I want to put an end to the  stereotype that only people in Asia can wear masks in public.
                            We all can get  infected by SARS-CoV-2 and we all can  infect others. Let‘s all #WearAF—ingMask.</p>
